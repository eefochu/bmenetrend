# Keyless map and Night style

The app uses MapLibre Native Android 11.8.0 with OpenFreeMap vector tiles, fonts and sprites. There is no map API key, billing setup or server of your own to configure. Build and run the app normally. Network access is needed for uncached tiles and fonts.

## Appearance

Light mode uses OpenFreeMap Positron. Dark mode loads `app/src/main/assets/map/night.json`, a local adaptation of OpenFreeMap Dark / OpenMapTiles Dark Matter. It changes cartography rather than tinting the screen:

| Feature | Colour |
| --- | --- |
| Land | Navy `#111D2C` |
| Water | Teal-blue `#15516B`, lighter cyan labels |
| Forests and parks | Emerald `#184838` / `#205443` |
| Local streets | Slate blue `#465E78` |
| Main roads | Pale blue-grey `#8195AA` |
| Motorways | Warm sand `#C39A73` |
| Railways | Lavender `#9C8DAF` |
| Place labels | Pale ice `#E1EAF3` with navy halos |

Road widths, zoom rules and label placement remain scale-aware. The existing transport marker colours stay unchanged. The system theme switches the basemap while retaining the current camera and selection. Outside route focus, low zoom hides stops below 12 and vehicles below 9; visible vehicles use coloured dots until zoom 12, then transport icons.

The bundled style can be edited directly or opened in [Maputnik](https://maplibre.org/maputnik/). It contains public resource URLs, not credentials. MapLibre keeps the attribution control above the bottom panel.

## Sources and licences

- [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) supplies the basemap resources without registration or API keys.
- Map data: [OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).
- Night style: modified [OpenFreeMap Dark](https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap-styles), based on [OpenMapTiles Dark Matter](https://github.com/openmaptiles/dark-matter-gl-style), derived from CartoDB Basemaps by Stamen and Paul Norman for CartoDB Inc. Code and design licence notices are bundled in `app/src/main/assets/map/licenses/`.
- Place search remains Photon / OpenStreetMap; transit data remains EMMA and the local operators.

Tile services receive the requesting IP address and the requested map areas. This is an online map, not a claim of offline use or anonymity.

## Selected line view

Selecting a vehicle loads its line patterns as well as its actual trip. The map shows the current line's shapes as separate paths, including both directions, and its independent source platforms. Active service patterns are preferred; the selected vehicle's actual trip is retained even when its pattern is absent from that day's line catalogue. Local lines use their known stop sequences for the view bounds; the app does not fabricate road geometry when no shape is supplied.

Other lines' vehicles and stops are hidden during selection. Vehicles match the provider-scoped route ID, rather than colour or route number alone. The focused view automatically fits all available paths and platforms above the bottom card and below the search bar. The Back arrow in the vehicle card, or Android Back, exits focus and restores the previous camera. A boarding selection has the same Back action.

The draw order is basemap → route casing/stroke → station halo/ring/centre → vehicle annotations. Stations use a separate GeoJSON circle layer, so vehicles stay above stations regardless of which arrived first in a live poll. Selected-line stops remain visible at the zoom needed for a complete line overview. Outside focus, the normal zoom visibility rules still apply.


## Station overviews and exiting route view

Below zoom 14.5, nearby platforms sharing a station parent or normalized name appear as one unnumbered station dot. Groups are limited to a 250-metre diameter to avoid combining distant same-name stops. The marker is centred on its members; it does not alter any source coordinate or departure-board identity. Groups whose platforms share one transport colour keep it; mixed-colour groups use a neutral dot. Groups apply to normal browsing and selected-line views. Tapping a grouped dot zooms in to reveal independently selectable platforms.

Overview dots have contrasting outlines; focused-line stations use 16-dp dots and individual focused platforms use 24-dp rings. Vehicle icons remain above them. The route fit leaves room for the search bar, the Exit route view button and the bottom card.

Hiding a station or vehicle card, including by dragging it down, clears route focus. Clearing boarding selection no longer reopens a dismissed sheet. Exit route view is also available directly below search, and Android Back exits route focus or hides an ordinary station card.
